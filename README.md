### A SunPCi (I) front-end for Linux

Rising Sun is a Rust re-implementation and reverse engineering of the Sun (Oracle) SunPCi software for Solaris on SPARC architectures. It provides a Linux kernel module and a Qt-based frontend for interfacing with the first generation of [SunPCi](https://www.zx.net.nz/computers/sun/cards/pci/SunPCi/) cards.

This project is a WIP, don't use in production (why would you anyway?)
